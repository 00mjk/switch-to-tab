'Switch to tab' is the result of playing around with Chromium's experimental
omnibox API.

Enter the single quotation mark (') into an empty omnibox to begin using
'Switch to tab'.

Upon pressing enter, the extension will select the first match and switch to
that tab, so one need not type press down if the first match is desired.
